    - Hero: *"Can't. It's me."*
    - *"This is the time to fight."*

### **Conflict**
- **Rising Stakes (Page 3):**
  - In a claustrophobic, metallic setting, a bearded father ("Frank") bids an emotional goodbye to his daughter, Snow, before heading into danger. Tension and dread mount as he warns her not to leave their sanctuary, even as metallic noises hint at confrontation just ahead.

### **Climax**
- **Catastrophe Unleashed (Page 4):**
  - Amidst chaos, heroes are beset by a monstrous, fiery creature—its tentacles and flames threatening to destroy them. As systems fail and doom looms ("We're falling out of orbit!"), a menacing, winged woman appears above Earth, signaling a new phase in the cosmic battle.
  - **Dramatic Moment:** Explosion of the monster, heroes entangled and desperate, a new villain revealed.
  - **Quotable Dialogue:**
    - *"God, get out of there—"*
    - *"No! Not yet! … Let it happen!"*
    - *"They're--they're still alive!"*
    - *"And so are we. For now."*
    - *"Every system is down! We're falling out of orbit!"*

### **Resolution**

**SCRIPT**

As the universe faces total annihilation, Earth's greatest heroes stand together with Venom beneath the looming shadow of the King in Black, Knull. While the world braces for the oncoming darkness, a lone survivor known as Frank prepares to make a final stand, stepping out from a rooftop and vowing that this is the time to fight. Deep inside a metallic bunker, Frank says a heartbreaking goodbye to his daughter Snow, promising that tonight will end the nightmare, as metallic echoes hint at the danger outside. With love and fear holding them together, Snow pleads for his return, but Frank heads straight into the chaos. Meanwhile, in low orbit, a monstrous, fiery creature attacks the heroes, wrapping them in flames and tentacles, as every system fails and the city begins to fall out of orbit. Amid the wreckage, a mysterious winged woman appears above Earth, signaling that the true battle is only beginning. As the last hope clings to survival, the heroes regroup, ready to face the wrath of Knull and the cosmic horror he brings with him.

**HOOK ANALYSIS**

The script opens by immediately placing the heroes and Venom in a dire situation under the threat of Knull, following the ComicShortsNarrativeProfile directive to start with a character or characters confronting a crisis. This establishes context and stakes, adhering to the pattern of presenting characters in situation, rather than posing a dramatic hook or question.
