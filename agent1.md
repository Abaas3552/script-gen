## STORY STRUCTURE

### 1. SETUP
- **Backdrop**: The Marvel Universe is plunged into chaos as a cosmic threat looms—Knull, the God of the Abyss, has arrived on Earth, bringing legions of darkness and unleashing the symbiote apocalypse.
- **Central Figure**: Venom (Eddie Brock) takes center stage, flanked by Marvel's mightiest heroes—Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Cyclops, Thing—signaling an unprecedented alliance.
- **Tone**: The world is in apocalyptic peril; the sky churns with chaotic energy as darkness spreads, and the ground trembles beneath the weight of invasion.

### 2. CONFLICT
- **Personal Stakes**: Amid the cosmic calamity, we zoom into a solitary figure—possibly Eddie or Dylan Brock—standing atop a city engulfed in fear and smoke, wrestling with paralyzing dread and the haunting presence of Knull.
- **Internal Struggle**: The narration reveals a battle within: “No more running. No more hiding. It’s time.” The confrontation is as much with fate as it is with the incoming god.
- **Family in Crisis**: Parallel to this, a young girl and her father find themselves barricaded in an industrial facility. The father desperately tries to keep his daughter safe from encroaching monstrosities, making a heartbreaking promise before venturing out alone.

### 3. CLIMAX
- **Cosmic Domination**: A colossal demonic entity (Knull or his avatar) erupts, its energy overwhelming the combined forces of the heroes.
- **Villainous Triumph**: A vampire-like conqueror—powerful, pale, and draped in shadows—hovers above Earth, chillingly declaring, “Everything that ever lived now belongs to me.”
- **Desperation Peaks**: Heroes are brought to their knees, their faces contorted in horror and disbelief, the skies ablaze with hellish energy as the fate of humanity teeters on the edge.

### 4. RESOLUTION (Implied, Not Shown)
- **Cliffhanger**: The world stands at the precipice of annihilation; with family bonds and heroism stretched to breaking, hope flickers even in darkness, setting the stage for an epic struggle to reclaim light.
